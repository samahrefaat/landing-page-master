# Landing Page Project

## Overview

A small project which is an exercise about what I have learnt about HTML, CSS, JS.

The project contains a navigation bar and dynamically added sections. You can navigate to the specified section by clicking on its related button on the navigation bar.

The scrolling to the section is made smoothly using only pure JavaScript (No CSS).
